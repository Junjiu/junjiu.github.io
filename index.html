    <div class="excerpt typo"><p>  Keep in mind that your cumulative reflection needs to cover:<br>How do you think ISU has prepared you to:<br>Design systems or processes?<br>Formulate and solve engineering problems?<br>Impact engineering solutions in a global/societal context?<br>Consider ethical implications of your engineering decisions?</p>
<p>What things have you done at ISU to prepare you to:<br>Work in groups?<br>Recognize contemporary issues?<br>Understand professional and ethical responsibilities?</p>
<p>In class projects &amp; problem solving tasks, did you draw upon information, research or experiences beyond what was provided in class to successfully complete your work? Please state which resources here and how they helped you to complete work (e.g. library resources, specific professional journals, experts in field, other students). </p>
<p>How did learning activities outside of the classroom (required 124.5 credits), such as Student Orgs, Career or Study Abroad Fairs, Undergraduate Research Experience (REU), or other university programs help you to understand the importance of Lifelong Learning? </p>
<p>Have you started to undertake any new learning to improve your ability to apply skills or knowledge to new problems and to develop confidence in taking risks? Please explain. </p>
<p>In the context of the first four questions, if you were to do your undergraduate work again, what things would you change? </p>
<p>1.<br>a) Pretty good, there are to course about it, I learned a lot from it.<br>b)Good, I get practiced in almost every course. But the problem always too simple.<br>c)No really good, I can’t remember something like that.<br>d)Good, I learned this from several course,<br>2.a)Many helpful group project.<br> B)Can’t remember something like that.<br> C)Analyze example of GV.<br>3.Yes. Google is very helpful, I can always find out solution on stack overflow.<br>4.I have done some internship. The really industry working environment is very helpful<br>to learn how to build reliable code.<br>5.Yes, I’m trying to learn machine learning by myself. I think machine learning will very<br>super useful in future program industry<br>6.I think I will do more practice about recognize contemporary issues by myself. I feel<br>what I learned is kind of far away to really industry<br></div>

    <div class="excerpt typo"><p>Submission of portfolio Gen Ed Narrative via Canvas</p>
<ol>
<li>Submit the (1) list of gen ed courses; (2) How/if they impacted engineering<br>education<br>to be included in your portfolio. Please describe how your General Education Courses<br>helped you to develop as a professional engineer. Write a reflection that incorporates your<br>thoughts on each of the following questions.<br>Phil230, RELIG210 and IntStd235.<br>General Education Courses help me build a view with human. Technology should serve human,<br>not leading human.</li>
<li><p>: What are your current short/long term goals? You may include your “ideal” career in<br>engineering or your preferred working environment.<br>My short goal is graduate on next 2019 May.<br>My long term goal is make the world better.<br>I hope be come a professional engineer, with great learning ability.</p>
</li>
<li><p>: What have you learned in your general education electives, which allow you to formulate<br>and evaluate engineering solutions in problem solving and innovation beyond the technical<br>aspects in problem solving? How do general education classes help you to think about an<br>engineering problem?<br>I think the PHIL230 helped me understand the world better. It is about Ethic. There are many<br>different idea about how ethic works. As an engineer, ethic is very important. We need to<br>make the world better, not worse.<br>And RELIG210 introduce America religions. As an engineer, we should understand people’s<br>religions. Because we are developing software for people. We need to know what they like<br>and what the is their taboo.<br>For IntStd235(International Study 235), obviously, a worldwide viewpoint is very important.<br>Nowadays, there are many global company, like google, facebook.</p>
</li>
<li>: Relate what you have learned in general education classes to seeing beyond the<br>engineering solution in problem solving and innovation. What are some other dimensions<br>to consider and what impact do they have in an economic, global or societal context?<br>For example, when we need to consider what technology to use, we need to think about the<br>requirement of this project. Based on the economic idea, we can use more suitable<br>technology. Like NoSql db is more good with huge load, but more expensive to maintain. If we<br>have to handle huge load, NoSql is better, otherwise, Sql is better.</div>

    <div class="excerpt typo"><p>When I was taking SE319, there was a project, which doesn’t have<br>some specific requirement, only requiring use JavaScript. I had<br>done some javaScript project before, but if I submit them, it may<br>cause ethical dilemmas. So I asked instructor whether I can use<br>the original code, which meet all the requirement of this project,<br>he said no. So I made a totally new project, and learn a lot.<br>I think when facing ethical dilemmas, the best solution is asking<br>some have experience, or just ask the one who will judge it later.<br>I think in our daily working, there will be many chance to reuse our<br>code. I think there are two point that we should take care. First,<br>we should know who is the code’s owner. Do we have the<br>ownership of the code, if so, we should be able to use it. Second,<br>the purpose of using the code is also very important. If it is for<br>academic reason, we must consider the academic dishonesty.<br>Anyway, adding a citation will always be the right thing to do.<br></div>
